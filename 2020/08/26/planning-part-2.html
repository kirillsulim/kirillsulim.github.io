<h2 id="estimation">Estimation</h2>

<p>I fill <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lOOvNDjSCl5XPfNrzS4E88az1ZR9D_s7rztrvic6jLU/edit?usp=sharing">table in Google Sheets</a> with user stories and put estimation in two cases:</p>

<ul>
  <li>SP50%: This is estiation in case everything goes normal</li>
  <li>SP90%: This is estimation in worst case</li>
</ul>

<p>After that I calculated standard deviation and with 90% probability my project will take 94 story points.</p>

<h2 id="stories-order">Stories order</h2>

<p>My epics are highly dependent on each other so I have a strict order from the beginning. I will start from investigation of new technologies, after that I will set up infrastructure and at the end I will create services.</p>

<p><em>Wish me luck =)</em></p>
