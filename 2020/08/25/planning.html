						<p>I will start with 10 questions from Agile Samurai book.</p>

<h2 id="1-why-we-are-here">1. Why we are here</h2>

<p><em>This is a quick reminder about why we are here, who our customers are, and why we decided to do this project in the first place.</em></p>

<p>I want to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Try more sophisticated plannign process.</li>
  <li>Create React version of my blog.</li>
</ol>

<p>I am my own customer as usual.</p>

<p>My project actualy is group of projects:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Authentification + Authorization service</li>
  <li>Image manager: a service for store images and its resized variants.</li>
  <li>Publisher framework: a service to publish post on many platforms, and blog is just one of them.</li>
  <li>Actual blog engine based on <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>.</li>
  <li>Learn <a href="https://get.foundation/">Zurb Foundation CSS framework</a>. Or any alternative if Zurb foundation will not be suitable for my goals.</li>
  <li>Learn <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>So my goal is not only get working product but learn some new technologies.</p>

<h2 id="2-elevator-pitch">2. Elevator pitch</h2>

<p>Here is group of projects:</p>

<h3 id="authentification--authorization-service">Authentification + Authorization service</h3>
<p>For me to authenticate user in many services.</p>

<h3 id="image-manager">Image manager</h3>
<p>For me to store images and solve resize problem in microservice-style. This is part of project infrastructure.</p>

<h3 id="publish-framework">Publish framework</h3>
<p>For me to publish posts not only to blog but also to different social networks. It could be transformed into commercial product in future.</p>

<h3 id="blog-engine">Blog engine</h3>
<p>For me to show my posts for social networks without extended interface.</p>

<h2 id="3-design-product-box">3. Design product box</h2>

<p>I will skip this part as usual.</p>

<h2 id="4-create-a-not-list">4. Create a NOT list</h2>

<p>This part will be hard, because it is already a monstrous bunch of microservices. But I will try anyway.</p>

<ol>
  <li>This is not commercial product yet.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="5-meet-your-neighbors">5. Meet your neighbors</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Hello devops Kirill!</li>
  <li>Hello developer Kirill!</li>
</ul>

<p>As usual I am my own devops and I want to use things like CI and tracing to make my life easier (or harder) and to learn new technoligies, so I should keep it in mind.</p>

<h2 id="6-show-the-solution">6. Show the solution</h2>

<h3 id="image-storage">Image storage</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Pyhton on backend (probably)</li>
  <li>Pgsql for metadata storage (or sqite?)</li>
  <li>Pod in k8s</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="publisher-framework">Publisher framework</h3>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://nestjs.com/">Nest.js</a> on backend probably</li>
  <li>React app with Zurb Foundation on frontend</li>
  <li>Post draft saved to pgsql</li>
  <li>Publishing to services is probably regular tasks reading <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/">Rabbit MQ</a> but this is questionable now. May be pgsql will be enough.</li>
  <li>Pod in k8s</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="actual-blog">Actual blog</h3>

<ul>
  <li>May be just a static site for now.</li>
  <li>Pod in k8s</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="7-ask-what-keeps-us-up-at-night">7. Ask what keeps us up at night</h2>

<p>First of all, I looks too complicated. Overengineering as its finest. 
But I have to clarify now. This is not a commercial project. It is more like enterprise-grade pet-project, so this is fine.</p>

<h2 id="8-size-it-up">8. Size it up</h2>

<p>This is a rough time estimation:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Authentication service. There should be many ready to use open-source projects, so I can just choose and set up one. One week.</li>
  <li>Image service estimation is approximatley can be written in one week of regular work.</li>
  <li>Publicher framework is much longer and in basic version is approximately fout weeks or one month of regular work.</li>
  <li>React based blog is easy but I will have to learn a lot about frontend. so I estimate it as two weeks.</li>
  <li>I’ve recently read a post about one guy who learned Kubernetes infrastructure in one month of evening work. So I estimate infrastructure part as 2 weeks.</li>
</ol>

<p>To summarize. Rough estimation of all work is ten weeks or two and a half month.</p>

<h2 id="9-be-clear-on-whats-going-to-give">9. Be clear on what’s going to give.</h2>

<h3 id="time">Time</h3>

<ol>
  <li>I wont restrict work on this project to some fixed time. Intead I will try to keep deliver some functionality regulary. Let’s call it “One man scrum”.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="scope">Scope</h3>

<p>Here are critical features:</p>

<ol>
  <li>I have to be able to publish my posts.</li>
  <li>I have to be able to show published posts on my blog.</li>
</ol>

<p>All other feature are really optional. But as far I am not restricted in time I can continue work until I will be content with result.</p>

<h3 id="budget">Budget</h3>

<p>I would like to keep it all running on small VPS, but there might be additional requirements. So I will set upper line to 20$ a month.</p>

<h3 id="quality">Quality</h3>

<p>Quality must be good as it is my personal project.</p>
